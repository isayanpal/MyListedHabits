## Inspiration
Resolutions are a part of New Year. However, many of us make the resolutions in our head, and then forget about them. So, we decided to make a webapp that will help us to save our resolutions, and track our habits.
## What it does
Our webapp, MyListedHabits, helps users to add their new year resolutions, and also to track their habits. A user can add any number of resolutions, and when completed, can click the check icon to strikethrough that item, and also click the delete icon to delete the resolution. There is also a Habits page that lets user track their habits. They can add a new habit, add the number of days they want to continue the habit, and when they have completed all number of days, the habit will be stroke-through. There is also a delete option to delete the habit.
## How we built 
We used HTML, CSS, Javascript to build the webapp. Among our team members, **Rajdeep De** handled the _UI/UX_ , **Ayushi Roy** handled _Web Development_ , **Sayan Pal** handled _Web Development_ , **Satyaki Dawn** handled _Web Development_ .
## Challenges we ran into
It was a bit of challenge to implement javascript in the navigation bar, and also in the habit tracker to increment the number of days when the habit is accomplished, and then to strike the habit. We also faced challenge while trying to deploy the website.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud to have successfully implement everything we wanted to, in the webapp, and also to have learnt a lot of new things.
## What we learned
We learned how to build a project from scratch in a limited time, how to successfully manage time, and co-ordinate with team members. Technically, we learned bootstrap, and a lot of javascript, especially about localStorage.

## What's next for MyListedHabits
MyListedHabits is planning to include a database to store the information entered by users. We are also planning to include a reminder feature that will send a message to the phone number entered by the user reminding them of their resolution at a time specified by the users.
